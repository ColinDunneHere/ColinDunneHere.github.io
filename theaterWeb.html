        </h3>
      </section>
      <section>
        <h3 class="webProjh3">Product</h3>
        <p class="webProjp">
A seat reservation website flow for a movie theater formatted for desktop and mobile devices.
        </p>
        <h3 class="webProjh3">Goal</h3>
        <p class="webProjp">
While learning and utilizing Adobe XD, produce website navigation that makes buying tickets and reserving seats intuitive, stress-free, and quick to aid the enjoyable movie experience.
        </p>






        <h2 class="webProjh2">Understanding the user</h2>

        <h3 class="webProjh3">User Research - Summary</h3>
        <p class="webProjp">
          I conducted interviews and created empathy maps to understand the users I’m designing for and their needs. A primary user group identified through research was young adults that are interested in seeing new movies (most commonly from the Marvel Universe).</p>

        <h3 class="webProjh3">User Research - Pain Points</h3>
        <h4 class="webProjh4">Pandemic</h4>
        <p class="webProjp">
          A notable amount of the identified primary user group has not been to theaters in a while due to the pandemic. While movies such as Black Widow (2021) were offered to be viewed via streaming services, more recent releases have not had the same treatment. If they want to watch the movie they must go to the theater, an activity that now often feels foreign to the primary user group.
        </p>
        <h4 class="webProjh4">Demand</h4>
        <p class="webProjp">
          The primary user group often shows interest in very popular new releases. Tickets are often bought ahead of time and sell out fast.
        </p>
        <h4 class="webProjh4">Safety</h4>
        <p class="webProjp">
          Safety concerns were often expressed by the primary user group seemingly from the culmination of factors regarding the pandemic health risks and the suspected large amount of people likely attending the popular movies. These feelings were largely accentuated through uncertainty- relating back to the primary user group often feeling foreign to the act of going to theaters again.
        </p>

        <h3 class="webProjh3">Site Map</h3>
        <p class="webProjp">A site map was created to show how pages are prioritized, linked, and labeled. This was done referencing preexisting established website structure models to create a design that meets user expectations, improves navigation, and improves time utilization by resourcing models that have been tested and proven effective.
The site map I created was primarily comprised of a mix of the hierarchical and sequential models. This was done to cater to the user's needs and the flow for reserving tickets.</p>

        <h2 class="webProjh2">Starting the Design</h2>

        <h3 class="webProjh3">Paper Wireframes</h3>
        <p class="webProjp">I found a strong interest in brutalist design while doing my research. While visually appealing and sometimes fun to interact with, the contrary approach to standard design practices had a tendency for navigation to be unclear to the user. Approaching my initial paper wireframes, I wanted to incorporate some elements while making a strong effort to preserve the integrity of the user experience.</p>
        <section class="webProjImgSect"><img src="img/web/theaterWebPaper.png"class="webProjImgSize"></section>


        <h3 class="webProjh3">Digital Wireframes</h3>
        <p class="webProjp">As the initial design phase continued, I focused screen designs on feedback and findings from the user research. The initial conceptualization seen in these digital wireframes was for the user to be able to scroll through the page with all of the interactable elements centered for the user's direct attention. The design of the other information was aimed to complement the centering of actions by having the noninteractive elements display their information in an appropriate place in the visual hierarchy.
<br><br>The same approach was taken and implemented into the mobile formats while making adjustments to ensure the structure was appropriate even on a smaller scale. </p>
<p class="webProjp"><br>This design was applied throughout all of the pages to keep the flow consistent, convenient, and easy for the user. </p>

<img src="img/web/theaterWebDigitalWire2.png" class="webProjLand">   


<h3 class="webProjh3">Low-Fidelity Prototype</h3>
        <p class="webProjp">Using the completed set of digital wireframes, I created a low-fidelity prototype. The primary user flow I connected was the seat reservation and ticket purchase. </p>

            <h3 class="webProjh3">Usability study: findings
</h3>
        <p class="webProjp">I conducted two rounds of usability studies. Findings from the first study helped guide the designs from wireframes to mockups. The second study used a high-fidelity prototype and revealed what aspects of the mockups needed refining.</p>
       
        <section class="webProjImgSide">
          <div>
          <h4 class="webProjh4">Round 1 Findings</h4>
          <p class="webProjp"><br>1. Users noted there were fewer movies available on the home page than what would normally be shown in a theater
   <br> <br>2. Users often did not scroll enough to see the "Coming Soon" section
     <br><br>3. At times, users wouldn't recognize where the enter button was in the flow
     <br><br>4. Users noted a lack of a ticket selection</p>
        </div>
        <div id="fug">
          <h4 class="webProjh4">Round 2 Findings</h4>
          <p class="webProjp"><br>1. Users still don't scroll enough to see the coming soon section
           <br> <br>2. Users did not know how to navigate backward in the ticket purchase flow
     <br><br>3. Users rarely read the description of the movie they were purchasing tickets for and never read it after the first step of the ticket purchase flow</p>
        </div>
        </section>




        <h2 class="webProjh2">Refining the design</h2>

        <h3 class="webProjh3">Mockups</h3>

<section class="webProjImgSide">
          <div>
          <p class="webProjp">Early designs allowed users to navigate well through centering all of the interactable elements in the home screen. This was discovered to be flawed as the initial design only displayed about 3 different movies in the “Now Showing” and “Coming Soon” sections. This was an inaccurate representation of the number of movies that would normally be displayed in a theater at a given time. The design was revised after these first-round findings to address this.</p>
        </div>
        <div id="fug">
          <section class="webProjImgSect"><img src="img/web/theaterWebMockup.png"class="webProjImgSize"></section>
        </div>
        </section>

        <section class="webProjImgSide" id="centerside">
          <div>
          <p class="webProjp">The second round of findings proved this to be a significant revision as the user’s interaction with the product changed revealing new findings. The second round findings demonstrated that users were not scrolling a lot when navigating the home page- leaving users not finding or accessing anything beyond half of the “Now Showing” section. Adjustments were made across new iterations to address this and other findings until the user testing proved the design to be effective.</p>
        </div>
        <div id="fug">
          <section class="webProjImgSect"><img src="img/web/theaterWebMockup2.png"class="webProjImgSize"></section>

         <h3 class="webProjh3">High-Fidelity Prototype</h3>
        <p class="webProjp">The final mockups presented a cleaner user flow, stronger visuals, more accessibility, and a shown improvement with user feedback and success rate compared to findings with previous designs.</p>
        <div class="buttonMarg" id="buttonMarg2">
        <a href="https://xd.adobe.com/view/69a2b3cc-4dca-4705-91b2-51334177d3f0-3cf1/">

                <div>Mobile</div> <img src="img/sendicon.svg" id="sendicon">
            </button></a></div>


            <h3 class="webProjh3">Accessibility Considerations</h3>
        <p class="webProjp"> <br>1. The revisions that were made following the 2nd round of findings were designed to allow for more navigation accessibility. One of the bigger adjustments that addressed this was putting the section names in the top navigation bar that would scroll to the appropriate section in the user were to click on them.
    <br><br> 2. Add the step of selecting a section in the “Seat Selection” page on the mobile version to make sure that the seat icons are an appropriate and more accessible size for the smaller format.
    <br><br> 3. Maintaining a contrast that guides users to and through icons, buttons, text while remaining in the WCAG (Web Content Accessibility Guidelines) and aiding the design’s hierarchy
    <br><br> 4. Providing clear icons to indicate where the reserved handicap seats were to ensure users who require such accommodations for movie viewing are able to access them and that users who don't require such accommodations don't reserve that seating on accident. 
    </p>

      <h2 class="webProjh2">Going Forward</h2>

        <h3 class="webProjh3">Takeaways & Impact</h3>
        <p class="webProjp">Users are able to find, reserve, and purchase movie seats and tickets successfully, quickly, and with ease.
         <br><br> One of the most critical things I learned was the extreme significance screen size plays in users' experience. When I was putting the final touches on this project, I actually happened to take my younger siblings and girlfriend to go and see Spiderman: No Way Home in one of the nearby AMC theaters. Before leaving, I opened up my phone to reserve seats and buy the tickets ahead of time. When I was on the site, I found that the UI seat selection happened to be very similar to the one I had made. However, it did differ in one way- it was not adjusted to the mobile format. Instead, the seats you were supposed to select were the size of grains on the screen. To make them bigger, you needed to pinch to zoom- which activated the browser zoom and the UI's zoom differently. What was supposed to be a simple step quickly turned into me becoming extremely aggravated. Was this intentional from the designers? Not in the slightest. I know that for a fact because I made the same mistake in my earlier mobile versions. After this happened I realized something. I was reminded of the relationship between revisions and experience, or in other words, the impacts that can be drawn from what I'm doing. 
It was a reminder of why I love doing this work.
